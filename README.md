## Project Structure

The project structure is organized into the following folders:

- **model:** Contains the pre-trained model file (`model.h5`) for Emotion Recognition.
- **data:** Placeholder for datasets or any necessary data.
- **xml:** Placeholder for XML files.
- **working:**
  - `dependencies.py`: File containing project dependencies.
  - `model.py`: File defining the architecture of the CNN model.
  - `split_data.py`: File implementing data splitting strategies.
  - `test.py`: File the performance of the model on the test data.
  - `train.py`: File handling model training.
  - `main.py`: Main executable file to run the Emotion Detection system.
